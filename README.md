## Requirements
- **PHP Server** - whole platform is flat-file based so simple hosting should do the work
- **SSL Certificate** - embedded apps are obliged to use https when using API. Either buy one of the SSL Certificates or find hosting with free Let's Encrypt feature (i.e. Bluehost.com)
- **Shopify Partner Account** - you need API keys to authenticate the app
- **Cron** - this is optional, but useful when you need to manage heavy processes (like importing 1k products, sending emails, etc.)

## Installation

## Credits
Here is the list of awesome stuff we used to build our platform:
- [Argon Dashboard](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/argon-dashboard) - one of the most beautiful (and free) dashboard themes
- [Icons8 Animal Icons](https://icons8.com/icon/pack/animals/color) - the whole library of fantastic icons (we use animals because they look cute :heart_eyes_cat:)
